A few words about me

#intro
I am a DevOps Engineer with over 6 years of experience in software development and cloud infrastructure, with a strong focus on the AWS platform. I work daily on automating environments, building robust CI/CD pipelines, and modernizing application infrastructureâ€”always aiming for efficiency, scalability, and security.

Currently, I work as a DevOps/Platform Engineer, responsible for planning, building, and maintaining production environments using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices with Terraform, provisioning Kubernetes clusters (EKS), and extensively leveraging AWS services such as ECS, RDS, CloudFormation, S3, IAM, Route53, among others. I also work with tools like Helm, ArgoCD, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.

I have hands-on experience in Linux environments, automation with Bash and Ansible, and knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Node.js, and Vue.js, which allows me to collaborate more effectively with development teams. I have worked on both optimizing infrastructure costs in production and implementing resilient and observable solutions using tools like Datadog, CloudWatch, and Velero.

I am AWS certified, currently studying Computer Networks, and passionate about technologies that increase system productivity and reliability. I believe in the DevOps culture as a fundamental pillar for delivering faster, safer, and more efficient solutions.

I am also a YouTuber and course creator in the DevOps field.
